Mz.\n            Karla left an incredible legacy of ballet and dance to the St. Croix\n            Valley and her inspiration continues to guide the studio through its\n            ongoing training and yearly performances.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            In recent summers, St. Croix Ballet's students were accepted into\n            some of nation's top dance programs including Royal Winnipeg Ballet,\n            Alvin Alley American Dance Theater, Indiana University Dance,\n            Joffrey Ballet, Ballet Austin, Milwaukee Ballet, Bossov Ballet,\n            Gelsey Kirkland Academy and numerous others. Our students are often\n            invited by the schools to stay year round. But each year all\n            students return in time (early August) to take St. Croix Ballet's\n            three-week Summer Intensive! In short, St. Croix Ballet training can\n            take a dancer as far as they wish to go in the dance world.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Many of our alumni have continued to dance throughout their college\n            careers and have majored or minored in dance. Several have gone on\n            to careers in dance and the arts. But all who have been part of the\n            St. Croix Ballet family throughout their elementary and high-school\n            years 'as their sport', have taken the discipline, training and the\n            love of dance and the arts and helped them forge successful life\n            trajectories and careers in many fields.
