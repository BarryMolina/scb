The Karla Sweeney Foundation for the Arts

In 2013, Susan Hovey took over as Director of the studio from
founder Karla Sweeney, who passed away (February 12, 2015) after a
gallant 15-year ongoing battle with late-stage breast cancer. Mz.
Karla left an incredible legacy of ballet and dance to the St. Croix
Valley and her inspiration continues to guide the studio through its
ongoing training and yearly performances.

For almost 20 years, St. Croix Ballet has maintained a non-profit affiliate to promote ballet and dance education and performing opportunities for students in the St. Croix Valley and the East Metro region. In 2016, the former "Ballet Jubilate' became 'The Karla Sweeney Foundation for the Arts' in honor of St. Croix Ballet's Founder Karla Sweeney.

Since 2013, an annual 'Evening on Pointe' fundraiser at the Grand Banquet Hall in downtown Stillwater has been held. The elegant event includes dinner, a silent auction, and special performances by St. Croix Ballet dancers. Evening on Point has become a beloved yearly tradition for the studio and an opportunity to for the community to further support youth and the arts in our region.
