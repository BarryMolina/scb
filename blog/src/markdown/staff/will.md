Will Kratz started as a student at St. Croix Ballet where he was instructed by Karla Sweeney and Susan Hovey and performed in all of the studio's productions from the Nutcracker, Spring Shows and the Summer Gala. In addition, Will has danced with Ballet Royal, Continental Ballet and Metropolitan Dance Academy as a guest artist, and has danced with Milwaukee Ballet, Academy of Russian Ballet, and Academy of Russian Classical Ballet for their Ballet Intensives. A highlight was performing in the Premier of the new ballet, Narnia. After graduation in 2015 Will performed as an apprentice with Minnesota Ballet Duluth for two seasons. With MN Ballet, Will toured with the company to Canada and throughout the Midwest, offered workshops for school children, and met with and performed for company Patrons at special events. A favorite aspect of ballet is the pas de deux and the unique challenge it presents for performances. When not dancing, Will is pursuing a degree in electrical technology.
