          <p>
            Karla Sweeney founded St. Croix Ballet in 1991 in the basement of
            the Sweeneyâ€™s Stillwater home. She built the program into one of the
            Twin Cities top ballet studios. After a gallant 15-year battle with
            late-stage breast cancer, Mz. Karla passed away on February 12,
            2015. Karla graduated from the University of Utah with a BFA in
            Ballet. She danced with Ballet West and several regional companies
            in the Southwest, performing in the Nutcracker, Les Sylphides,
            Coppelia, and others. She then toured the United States and Mexico
            as the featured dancer with Disney on Parade Mary Poppins show, and
            then traveled to England and South Africa with other Disney
            productions.{' '}

                Karla has left a beautiful legacy of quality ballet and dance to
                the St. Croix Valley. For almost 20 years, St. Croix Ballet has
                maintained a non-profit affiliate to promote ballet and dance
                education and performing opportunities for students in the St.
                Croix Valley and the East Metro region.{' '}

              <p>
                In 2016, the former "Ballet Jubilate' became 'The Karla Sweeney
                Foundation for the Arts' in honor of St. Croix Ballet's Founder.
                Since 2013, an annual 'Evening on Pointe' fundraiser at the
                Grand Banquet Hall in downtown Stillwater has been held. The
                elegant event includes dinner, a silent auction, and special
                performances by St. Croix Ballet dancers. Evening on Point has
                become a beloved yearly tradition for the studio and an
                opportunity to for the community to further support youth and
                the arts in our region.
