Our students study\n            the Vagonova Method, building a firm foundation of strength, rigor,\n            and discipline. Our classes are Ballet First, but dancers get a wide\n            range of styles at our summer intensive, and many of our students\n            are accomplished Jazz, Modern, and Character dancers.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"two\" className=\"spotlights\">\n        <section>\n          <Link to=\"/generic\" className=\"image\">\n            <img src={pic08} alt=\"\" />\n          </Link>\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Student Success</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                Our students have been accepted into programs at the Royal\n                Winnipeg Ballet, Alvin Alley American Dance Theater, Indiana\n                University Dance, Joffrey Ballet, Ballet Austin, Milwaukee\n                Ballet, Bossov Ballet, Gelsey Kirkland Academy and numerous\n                others.

Our\n                Nutcracker has been performed for nearly three decades, and is a\n                fixture of the St. Croix Valley. The spring show is a student\n                favorite as well, and in the past we've done Copellia, Sleeping\n                Beauty and Cinderella. We host a three-week summer intensive\n                that teaches modern, character, jazz, ballet, and Pilates; it\n                culminates in a Summer Gala performance in Stillwater's\n                picturesque Pioneer Park. In addition, periodic Master Classes\n                by guest artists and intensives are offered throughout the year.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <Link to=\"/generic\" className=\"image\">\n            <img src={pic10} alt=\"\" />\n          </Link>\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Pre Ballet</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                St. Croix Ballet is excited to offer Pre-Ballet (ages 3-4) and\n                Level I-1 (ages 5-6) classes that meet Minnesota state standards\n                for preschool.
