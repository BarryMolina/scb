Karla passed away on February 12,\n            2015. Karla graduated from the University of Utah with a BFA in\n            Ballet. She danced with Ballet West and several regional companies\n            in the Southwest, performing in the Nutcracker, Les Sylphides,\n            Coppelia, and others. She then toured the United States and Mexico\n            as the featured dancer with Disney on Parade Mary Poppins show, and\n            then traveled to England and South Africa with other Disney\n            productions.{' '}\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"two\" className=\"spotlights\">\n        <section>\n          <img className=\"image\" src={basement} alt=\"\" />\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Legacy</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                Karla has left a beautiful legacy of quality ballet and dance to\n                the St. Croix Valley.
