Karla passed away on February 12,\n            2015. Karla graduated from the University of Utah with a BFA in\n            Ballet. She danced with Ballet West and several regional companies\n            in the Southwest, performing in the Nutcracker, Les Sylphides,\n            Coppelia, and others. She then toured the United States and Mexico\n            as the featured dancer with Disney on Parade Mary Poppins show, and\n            then traveled to England and South Africa with other Disney\n            productions.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Karla has left a beautiful legacy of quality ballet and dance to the\n            St. Croix Valley. jmp Karla Sweeney313.jpg For almost 20 years, St.\n            Croix Ballet has maintained a non-profit affiliate to promote ballet\n            and dance education and performing opportunities for students in the\n            St. Croix Valley and the East Metro region.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In 2016, the former \"Ballet Jubilate' became 'The Karla Sweeney\n            Foundation for the Arts' in honor of St. Croix Ballet's Founder.\n            Since 2013, an annual 'Evening on Pointe' fundraiser at the Grand\n            Banquet Hall in downtown Stillwater has been held.
