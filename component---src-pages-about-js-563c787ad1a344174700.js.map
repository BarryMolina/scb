We utilize the Russian Vagonova Method which serves as the\n            foundational teaching of our program. In addition, dancers are\n            introduced to a wide variety of dance styles throughout the year,\n            including Modern, Character and others.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section id=\"two\" className=\"spotlights\">\n        <section>\n          <img className=\"image\" src={cindy} alt=\"\" />\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Student Success</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                Our students have been accepted into programs at the Royal\n                Winnipeg Ballet, Alvin Alley American Dance Theater, Indiana\n                University Dance, Joffrey Ballet, Ballet Austin, Milwaukee\n                Ballet, Bossov Ballet, Gelsey Kirkland Academy and numerous\n                others. Many of our students enroll in dance programs in college\n                or go on to dance professionally. In other words, for those\n                pursuing a professional dance tract, our training prepares our\n                students for numerous professional dance opportunities.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <img className=\"image\" src={performance} alt=\"\" />\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>Performance Opportunities</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                We host two ballets during the course of the year. Our\n                Nutcracker has been performed for nearly three decades, and is a\n                fixture of the St. Croix Valley. The spring show is a student\n                favorite as well, and in the past we've done Copellia, Sleeping\n                Beauty and Cinderella. We host a three-week summer intensive\n                that teaches modern, character, jazz, ballet, and Pilates; it\n                culminates in a Summer Gala performance in Stillwater's\n                picturesque Pioneer Park. In addition, periodic Master Classes\n                by guest artists and intensives are offered throughout the year.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <img className=\"image\" src={gigionne} alt=\"\" />\n          <div className=\"content\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h3>A Foundation For Life</h3>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                Of course, not everyone will be a professional dancer. Many\n                dancers with St. Croix Ballet simply choose ballet as their\n                elementary or high school 'sport'. We've had the honor of\n                watching these students take with them the discipline, training\n                and the love of dance as they forge successful life trajectories\n                and careers in many fields. Of this, we are most proud.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default Landing\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/cindy-5701a4f06a71d96f22ae2ce39321e635.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/performance-191ab0476bd62bea77c045408ee3c68a.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/gigionne-73b784a7b263a83c9682e1745ffd305a.jpg\";","import React from 'react'\n\nconst BannerLanding = props => (\n  <section id=\"banner\" className=\"style2\">\n    <div className=\"inner\">\n      <header className=\"major\">\n        <h1>About St. Croix Ballet</h1>\n      </header>\n      <div className=\"content\">\n        <p>one of the Twin Cities' Top Ballet Studios</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n)\n\nexport default BannerLanding\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
